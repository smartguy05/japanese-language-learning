High Priority (Biggest Learning Impact)

  1. Text-to-Speech Audio Pronunciation 🔊

  Use the Web Speech API to speak Japanese words/sentences. This is crucial because:
  - Listening is essential for language learning
  - Users can practice pronunciation
  - Helps associate written characters with sounds
  - Already supported by browsers (no external dependencies)

  2. Spaced Repetition System (SRS) 🧠

  Implement intelligent review scheduling based on performance:
  - Show words at optimal intervals (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, etc.)
  - Prioritize words the user struggles with
  - Reduce review frequency for mastered items
  - Similar to Anki's algorithm
  - Dramatically improves long-term retention

  3. Enhanced Progress Dashboard 📊

  Visual analytics showing:
  - Accuracy trends over time (line charts)
  - Words mastered per day/week
  - Study streak calendar
  - Time spent per mode
  - Weakest areas needing focus
  - Helps maintain motivation and track improvement

  4. Daily Goals & Streaks 🎯

  Gamification to build consistency:
  - Set target (e.g., "Review 20 words per day")
  - Visual streak counter (🔥 5 days!)
  - Celebration when goals met
  - Gentle reminders when goals at risk
  - Research shows daily habits are key to language learning

  5. Smart Review Mode 🎓

  Dedicated mode that:
  - Automatically selects words marked "needs review"
  - Mixes modes (alphabet → sentence → flashcard)
  - Adjusts difficulty based on recent performance
  - Focuses study time where it's needed most

  Medium Priority (Good Enhancements)

  - Critical for sentence construction

  10. Study Session Timer ⏱️

  Track time spent studying:
