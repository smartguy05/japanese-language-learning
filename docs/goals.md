## Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope for MVP)

To maintain focus and ensure timely delivery, the following are explicitly **NOT** goals for the MVP:

### ❌ Backend Infrastructure
- **Not Included:** User accounts, authentication, cloud storage
- **Reason:** Adds complexity, hosting costs, and privacy concerns
- **Alternative:** Local data with export/import for cross-device sync

### ❌ Advanced Gamification
- **Not Included:** Leaderboards, achievements, competitive features
- **Reason:** Requires backend, may distract from core learning
- **Future Enhancement:** Can be added post-MVP if user demand exists

### ❌ Kanji Learning
- **Not Included:** Kanji character recognition and study
- **Reason:** Significantly more complex (2,000+ characters vs. 92 kana)
- **Future Enhancement:** Major feature for version 2.0

### ❌ Audio Pronunciation
- **Not Included:** Text-to-speech or audio playback
- **Reason:** Would require external API or large audio file storage
- **Future Enhancement:** Can use Web Speech API in future version

### ❌ Grammar Explanations
- **Not Included:** Grammar rules, particles, sentence structure guides
- **Reason:** Content-heavy, requires expert linguistic input
- **Future Enhancement:** Link to external grammar resources in settings

### ❌ Social Features
- **Not Included:** Friend connections, shared study sessions, messaging
- **Reason:** Requires backend infrastructure and moderation
- **Future Enhancement:** Consider for community-focused version

### ❌ Native Mobile Apps
- **Not Included:** React Native, iOS, or Android native builds
- **Reason:** PWA provides 90% of native benefits with less complexity
- **Future Enhancement:** Evaluate if PWA limitations become critical

### ❌ Multi-Language Interface
- **Not Included:** UI translated to multiple languages (Spanish, French, etc.)
- **Reason:** Adds translation overhead and maintenance burden
- **Future Enhancement:** Community translations post-MVP

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks

**Risk 1: LocalStorage Quota Limitations**
- **Probability:** Medium (5-10MB typical limit)
- **Impact:** High (potential data loss)
- **Mitigation:** 
  - Warn users when approaching 80% of quota
  - Implement data compression for export
  - Document IndexedDB migration path for future
  - Encourage regular exports for backup

**Risk 2: Character Mapping Accuracy**
- **Probability:** Medium (edge cases with compound characters)
- **Impact:** Medium (affects learning effectiveness)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Extensive testing with diverse Japanese text samples
  - Use WanaKana library for character detection
  - Allow manual romanji editing as fallback
  - Community feedback for edge case identification

**Risk 3: PWA Installation Friction on iOS**
- **Probability:** High (iOS Safari has PWA limitations)
- **Impact:** Medium (users can still use web version)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Provide clear, step-by-step iOS installation instructions
  - Test thoroughly on actual iOS devices
  - Consider iOS-specific optimizations
  - Graceful fallback to web app experience

### Medium Priority Risks

**Risk 4: User Engagement Plateau**
- **Probability:** Medium (novelty may wear off without gamification)
- **Impact:** Medium (affects retention metrics)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement basic streak tracking (daily study motivation)
  - Provide satisfying progress visualizations
  - Plan post-MVP gamification features
  - Gather user feedback on engagement preferences

**Risk 5: Performance on Low-End Devices**
- **Probability:** Low (modern devices generally capable)
- **Impact:** Medium (poor user experience for some users)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test on throttled devices early in development
  - Optimize animations with requestAnimationFrame
