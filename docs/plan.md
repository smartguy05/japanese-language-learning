## Risk Management

### Identified Risks & Mitigation

#### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: LocalStorage Quota Exceeded**
- **Probability:** Low-Medium (5-10MB typical limit, adequate for 500+ words)
- **Impact:** High (data loss if not handled)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Implement quota detection with fallback
  - Compress export JSON
  - Warn user when approaching limit
  - Document IndexedDB migration path

**Risk 2: Character Mapping Complexity**
- **Probability:** Medium (edge cases with compound characters)
- **Impact:** Medium (affects alphabet mode accuracy)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Thoroughly test with diverse word samples
  - Use WanaKana library for character detection
  - Implement manual romanji edit as fallback
  - Document known limitations

**Risk 3: PWA Installation Issues**
- **Probability:** Medium (iOS Safari has limitations)
- **Impact:** Medium (degrades to web app experience)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Ensure manifest meets all requirements
  - Provide clear iOS installation instructions
  - Test on actual iOS devices early
  - Gracefully degrade if not installable

**Risk 4: Performance on Low-End Devices**
- **Probability:** Low-Medium (modern devices generally capable)
- **Impact:** Medium (poor user experience)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Test on throttled devices (Chrome DevTools)
  - Optimize animations (requestAnimationFrame)
  - Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
  - Profile and fix bottlenecks early

#### Schedule Risks

**Risk 5: Feature Creep**
- **Probability:** High (enthusiasm for new features)
- **Impact:** High (delays MVP launch)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Strict MVP scope adherence
  - Document future enhancements separately
  - Time-box each phase strictly
  - User stories prioritized as Must/Should/Could

**Risk 6: Underestimated Complexity**
- **Probability:** Medium (character mapping, PWA setup)
- **Impact:** Medium (phase delays)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Build in 20% buffer time per phase
  - Daily progress tracking
  - Early prototype of complex features
  - Adjust schedule proactively if needed

#### User Experience Risks

**Risk 7: Japanese Input Method Issues**
- **Probability:** Medium (device keyboard variations)
- **Impact:** Medium (frustration adding words)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Integrate WanaKana for romanji conversion
  - Provide paste-from-other-app option
  - Document how to enable Japanese keyboard
  - Test on multiple devices early

**Risk 8: Accessibility Gaps**
- **Probability:** Low (with proper planning)
- **Impact:** High (excludes users with disabilities)
- **Mitigation:**
  - Accessibility built-in from day 1
  - Regular screen reader testing
  - Follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines
  - Automated Lighthouse audits

## Communication & Reporting

### Daily Standups (Self-Reporting)
If working solo, maintain a daily log:
- **Yesterday:** What was completed
- **Today:** What will be worked on
- **Blockers:** Any impediments

### Weekly Review
End of each week, review:
- Features completed vs planned
- Any scope changes or delays
- Updated timeline if needed
- Risks identified or resolved

### Milestone Demos
After each phase, conduct a self-demo:
1. Record short video demonstrating features
2. Test on actual mobile device
3. Note any issues or improvements needed
4. Update progress.md with checkpoint status

## Version Control Strategy

### Branch Structure
```
main (production-ready code)
├── develop (integration branch)
│   ├── feature/phase1-foundation
│   ├── feature/phase2-alphabet-mode
│   ├── feature/phase3-sentence-mode
│   ├── feature/phase4-flashcard-mode
│   ├── feature/phase5-word-management
│   └── feature/phase6-pwa-polish
└── hotfix/* (emergency fixes)
```

### Commit Convention
```
feat: Add character reveal animation to alphabet mode
fix: Resolve LocalStorage quota detection bug
docs: Update README with installation instructions
style: Apply consistent spacing in navigation
refactor: Extract useWordSelection to custom hook
test: Add unit tests for distractor generation
chore: Update dependencies to latest versions
```

### Release Process
1. Complete all Phase 6 validation criteria
2. Merge develop → main
3. Tag release: `v1.0.0`
4. Build production bundle
5. Deploy to hosting service
6. Announce release

## Deployment Plan

### Environment Setup

**Development**
```bash
npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:3000
```

**Staging (Optional)**
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
# Tests production build locally
```

**Production**
```bash
npm run build
# Outputs to /dist directory
# Deploy /dist to static hosting
```

### Hosting Options

**Recommended: Netlify (Easiest)**
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `dist`
4. Automatic HTTPS and CDN
5. Free tier sufficient

**Alternative: Vercel**
- Similar setup to Netlify
- Excellent performance
- Free tier available

**Self-Hosted (Your Tiny Server)**
- Nginx configuration (see design.md)
- Manual SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)
- Serve /dist as static files
- Full control, more setup effort

### Pre-Launch Checklist
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Lighthouse audits > 90 (Performance, Accessibility, PWA)
- [ ] Tested on real mobile devices (Android + iOS)
- [ ] Offline functionality verified
- [ ] Service worker registered correctly
- [ ] Manifest.json configured properly
- [ ] Icons in all required sizes
- [ ] README.md complete
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md created
- [ ] Git tag created (v1.0.0)

### Post-Launch Monitoring
- Check for errors in browser console
- Monitor LocalStorage usage
- Gather user feedback
- Track installation rate (if analytics added later)
- Note any browser-specific issues
